# UDPReliableFileTransfer
A command-line file transfer program in Java that utilizes UDP socket programming. This program seeks to provide reliable transfer by being able to handle if packets are lost, duplicated, out-of-order, or corrupted. A "server" may handle multiple file requests by multiple "clients" in this program.
